# Meteora Studio

A collection of scripts for interacting with Meteora's programs to innovate and create token
launches. Part of the **Meteora Invent** toolkit.

## 🏗️ Structure

Studio consists of 4 main pool types, each with dedicated scripts and configurations:

- **DLMM** (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) - Dynamic fees and precise liquidity concentration
- **DAMM V2** (Dynamic AMM V2) - Enhanced constant product AMM with advanced features
- **DAMM V1** (Dynamic AMM V1) - Constant product AMM with lending integration
- **DBC** (Dynamic Bonding Curve) - Permissionless launch pool protocol

Studio also contains a collection of scripts for interacting with other Meteora programs:

- **Alpha Vault** - A complementary anti-bot mechanism used together with a Launch Pool.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 9.0.0

### Installation

From the root of the meteora-invent repository:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the environment variables:

```bash
cp studio/.env.example studio/.env
```

Add your private key and RPC URL to the `.env` file.

2. Optional: Start a Local Test Validator

_You can also run the studio scripts on localnet - http://localhost:8899 with the following command_

```bash
pnpm studio start-test-validator
```

3. Generate a keypair from your private key:

```bash
# For devnet (airdrops 5 SOL)
pnpm generate-keypair --network devnet

# For localnet (airdrops 5 SOL)
# Ensure that you have already started the local validator with pnpm start-test-validator
pnpm generate-keypair --network localnet
```

4. Configure the config files in the `studio/config` directory:

- [DLMM Config](./config/dlmm_config.jsonc)
- [DAMM v2 Config](./config/damm_v2_config.jsonc)
- [DAMM v1 Config](./config/damm_v1_config.jsonc)
- [DBC Config](./config/dbc_config.jsonc)
- [Alpha Vault Config](./config/alpha_vault_config.jsonc)

**Note:** You can use the provided example configurations as a starting point. Make sure to replace
the placeholders with your actual values.

## 📖 Program Details

### Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC)

The Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) program is a permissionless launch pool protocol that allows any
launch partners to enable their users to launch tokens with customizable virtual curves directly on
their platform (e.g. launchpad). This allows their users to create a new token and create a Dynamic
Bonding Curve pool where anyone can buy tokens based on that bonding curve.

### Dynamic AMM V1 (DAMM V1)

Constant product AMM that supports token prices from 0 to infinity. LPs can earn additional yield by
utilizing lending sources alongside traditional swap fees, enhancing their returns.

### Dynamic AMM V2 (DAMM V2)

Dynamic AMM v2 is a constant-product AMM program, with features that optimize transaction fees and
provide greater flexibility for liquidity providers, launchpads, and token launches. DAMM v2 comes
with SPL and Token 2022 token support, optional concentrated liquidity, position NFT, dynamic fee,
on-chain fee scheduler, new fee claiming mechanism and fee token selection, more flexible liquidity
locks, and an in-built farming mechanism. Unlike DAMM v1, DAMM v2 is not integrated with Dynamic
Vaults. DAMM v2 is a new program, and not an upgrade of the Dynamic AMM v1 program.

### Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM)

DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) gives LPs access to dynamic fees to capitalize on volatility,
and precise liquidity concentration all in real-time, with the flexibility to select their preferred
volatility strategy.

### Alpha Vault

Alpha Vault is a complementary anti-bot mechanism used together with a Launch Pool that provides
early access for genuine supporters to deposit and purchase tokens before the pool starts trading,
thereby getting tokens at the earliest price and helping to safeguard the token launch against
sniper bots.
